# Giraffe Chain Docs

Welcome to the official documentation portal for Giraffe Chain. You'll find information on how to run and interact with the chain. You'll also find some general information about blockchains and graph databases.

If you're unfamiliar with blockchains or web3, head on over to the [Fundamentals](./fundamentals.md) page for a short introduction. While Giraffe aims to be intuitive for all users, web3 requires a shift in a mindset from what we're all used to.

If you're already familiar with blockchain concepts, check out the [dApp Development](./dapp-development) docs.

To view the current testnet, go to https://testnet.giraffechain.com. For more information on testnets, check out the [Testnet](./testnets) docs.
