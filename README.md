## Approach
The Blockchain is a choose-your-adventure book, written by members of the community.  It employs a "Proof-of-Human" consensus approach where block production, block validation, and chain selection are interactive and subjective.  Most of the underlying systems are still automated, but consensus is derived through creativity.  Everyone is welcome to participate at any moment, with no registration required.

The blockchain begins with a "genesis" block.  This block contains an open-ended story prompt.  Each subsequent block adds a small continuation to the story, written by a human.  Humans interactively select the most human-sounding continuations to the story.
